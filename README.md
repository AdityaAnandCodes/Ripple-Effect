## Problem Statement

Track Chosen - Game Development / AR / VR  
Leveraging the world of open source to generate a social impact  

## Overview

**Ripple Effect** is a idea we went with during Aventus 2.0 - a National Level 24 hours Hackathon. the idea was clear We wanted to address the issue of water scarcity and promote water conservation through the game while letting the player enjoy the thrill and fun a game offers. So we went with a time constraint based game to overwhelm the player with task this also gave the game the prespective of generating a urgency for actions against the ongoing crisis. we faced issues as the mechanics grew complex and with the time frame we had to cut down many mechanics while execution. but it turned out to be a great project where we got to learn many things and it ended up as a fun to play game while addressing the issues it was supposed to which led us to secure 2nd Prize in the hackathon.  

## Gameplay

The game offers a immersive environment with good aesthetic map and functioning components that offer interactivity to the player within the map. Ripple effect tries to lure you into a world where you are responsible for the water level of the city and to win or to survive you must perform actions that helps raise or maintain the water level of the city while the ongoing crisis and problems deal major damage to the water level. you must be fast and act carefully within the time frame to win the game. sounds and animations are features added in the game to maintain the immersiveness of the game.

### Objectives

- Interact with the citizens.
- Install Rain Water Harvesting system into houses. 
- Address issues like pipe leaks and open water taps that accelerate water loss.
- Ensure the city's water level remains above zero to win the game.
- Play within the time-contraint.
